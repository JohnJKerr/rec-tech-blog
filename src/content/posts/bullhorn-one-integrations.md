So you've been tasked with creating a Bullhorn One integration, and you're staring at the long list of endpoints and 
wondering where to get started? Well, fear not, as we've been exactly where you are and we're hear to shed some light

post on authenticating with Bullhorn.

Onto the Bullhorn One specifics. There are a LOT of endpoints! ðŸ˜… Fortunately, you can identify most of them by

of an endpoint without the "Pay and Bill" prefix. While you can potentially get _some_ useful data from there, such 
as hours worked, from a revenue perspective that endpoint is largely useless.

Instead, you want to be looking at
